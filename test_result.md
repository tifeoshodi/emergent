# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"
#
# Main agent responsibilities:
# 1. Update the test_result.md file with the current implementation status
# 2. Set `implemented: true` when a feature is ready for testing
# 3. Set `needs_retesting: true` when a feature needs to be retested
# 4. Update the `test_plan` section to guide the testing agent
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Test the EPC project management frontend application I just built. The app should be accessible and working properly. Key features to test: 1. Dashboard Page: Should show stats cards with project/task counts, recent tasks, and recent projects 2. Task Management Page: Should allow creating independent tasks, viewing task cards, and updating task status 3. Project Management Page: Should allow creating projects, selecting projects, and viewing Kanban boards for each project 4. Navigation: Should work between Dashboard, Tasks, and Projects pages 5. Forms: Should work for creating new tasks and projects with proper validation 6. Status Updates: Should allow updating task status through buttons on task cards and kanban board 7. User Assignment: Should show assigned users on tasks and allow assignment during creation. The backend has sample data: - 7 users with different EPC roles (Project Manager, Engineers, Contractors) - 3 sample projects (Oil Refinery Expansion, Gas Pipeline, Offshore Platform) - Multiple tasks both independent and project-specific. The app uses React with Tailwind CSS, purple theme, and should be responsive. Make sure all the core functionality works end-to-end including data persistence between page refreshes."
